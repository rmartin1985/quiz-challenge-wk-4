# quiz-challenge-wk-4

Who doesn't love a good multiple choice game? 

This weeks challenge was to create a multiple choice quiz based on JavaScript questions. This challenge tested the limits of how much I have learned up to this point in the few short weeks I have been in this bootcamp. 

In order to make this quiz function properly, I had to use JavaScript and the DOM in order to make the quiz more interactive. 

Just a few of what I had to use in order to make this function properly:
* setInterval
* for loop
* if/else
* localStorage
* DOM manipulation 
    * querySelector
    * eventListener
    * setAttribute

## Usage

* Upon loading the page, the user will see a screen with instructions for how the scoring works.
* When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, they are presented with the first question and the timer will start in the upper right hand corner. 
* There will be a question with 4 possible answers. 
* If the correct answer is selected, a message will pop up stating "Correct!"
* If the incorrect answer is selected, a message will pop up stating "Incorrect!" and 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. 
* Once the last question has been answered, the timer will stop and that will be the final score for the user. They will also see how many questions they got right out of the possible 5.
* The user is asked to enter their initials for the high scores.
* Once they submit their initials, they are presented with the top 5 scores, in order from highest to lowest. 
* They are then presented with two buttons:
    * They can click "Play Again" and be taken back to the start page.
    * Or they can click "Clear High Scores" if they would like to clear their local storage and start fresh with zero high scores.
